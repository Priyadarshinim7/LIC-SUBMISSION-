Design and analysis of the MOSFET differential 
amplifier circuit for the following specifications 

common mode differential amplifier:
A common mode differential amplifier amplifies the difference between two input signals while rejecting signals that are common to both.
It consists of two transistors, a current source, and load resistors or active loads. The amplifier operates in two modes: differential mode, 
where opposite signals are amplified, and common mode, where identical signals are ideally canceled. A key parameter is the Common Mode Rejection 
Ratio (CMRR), which indicates how well the amplifier rejects common-mode signals. These amplifiers are widely used in instrumentation, sensor 
signal conditioning, and communication systems to improve noise immunity.

CIRCUIT DESIGN:
A common mode differential amplifier consists of two matched transistors,a current source, and load resistors or active loads. The input signals are 
applied to the bases of the transistors, while the emitters share a common connection to the current source. In differential mode, when one input 
increases and the other decreases, the circuit amplifies the difference between them.In common mode, when both inputs change together, the output ideally remains unchanged, rejecting noise and interference.
The amplifier's performance is characterized by its differential gain, common-mode gain, and Common Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR). 
High CMRR ensures better noise immunity, making this circuit essential in operational amplifiers, instrumentation systems, and communication.
